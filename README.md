# Day-Planner
As an employee with a busy schedule. It is important to be able to place important meetings and events in a schedule.

When you open the planner the current day is displayed.

When you scroll down you are presented with timeblocks for standard business hours.

When you view the timeblock, it is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future.

When you click into a timeblock you are able to enter an event.

Then you will click on the save button and your event will be saved in local storage.

When you refresh the page the saved events persist.
